    "## Turning Wards in Geography\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous notebook, we normalized OpenElection ward names from the county clerk's \"Reporting Units\" and into an easier-to-parse and standard list of wards. Now, let's add in some Geo Data. The [LTSB Open Data Portal](http://data.ltsb.opendata.arcgis.com/) is based on ArcGIS and allows you to download data on every ward in the State as a CSV, a Shapefile, or as a KML file. To keep it simple, let's download the CSV version of the 2016 Fall wards. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The LTSB ArcGIS portal doesn't have 2014 ward data, so we're using 2016 ward maps to join against the 2014 OpenElections results.** This is mostly OK - a few boundaries will have changed due to annexations, and the two other big changes were two towns incorporated as villages. Strictly speaking, however, the maps don't quite line up right. We'll update this notebook to use 2016 OpenElections results in the future, and then the boundaries and results will be aligned. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, this is probably as good as any place to note that the LTSB also publishes election results, and does so in as spreadsheets and shapefiles, broken down by ward. **There are no actual Statewide, ward-level results in Wisconsin. The LTSB processes the GAB/Elections Commission results to create them, just like we're doing here**. Because a given reporting unit might have multiple wards, it is impossible to say how exactly a given ward voted. The LTSB proportionally allocates votes to each ward in a reporting unit, weighted by the population of the wards. (And not, alas, by the turnout of each ward, which would at least be slightly more accurate.) If you want to know how two wards voted, you literally have to go to the Clerk's office and inspect the ballots. Also, because the LTSB has to use the Census data to weight by population, they can use the Census demographics to estimate the racial makeup of a given ward, but again, the LTSB weights by population and doesn't look at the actual Voter File to see who turned out (and Wisconsin doesn't how a voter racially identifies in the voter file anyway) these are just estimates. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start again with the preliminaries - bring in Pandas and set some blogging-friendly defaults, and then actually load the ward data."
