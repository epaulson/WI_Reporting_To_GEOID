    "# Deriving \"Precinct\" level results for Wisconsin\n",
    "\n",
    "### tl;dr: Over a [few notebooks](https://github.com/epaulson/WI_Reporting_To_GEOID), we'll show how to join Wisconsin election results to ward(precinct) shapefiles\n",
    "\n",
    "> What we in Wisconsin call a ward is referred to as a precinct in some states or a voting district by the\n",
    "Census Bureau. Wards do not constitute election districts from which municipal officials are elected, and\n",
    "thus are not subject to the “one person, one vote” requirement which governs the formation of election\n",
    "districts. Instead, wards are intended to serve as administrative subunits that are aggregated into election\n",
    "districts of equal population. Cities, villages, and towns form municipal wards by combining whole\n",
    "census blocks...Once established, wards serve as the building blocks used by the legislature, counties, and cities in redistricting their respective election districts. -- [Wisconsin Elections Commission](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/misc/lrb/redistricting_information/guidelines_2020.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "The [OpenElections Project](http://www.openelections.net) is compiling a set of standardized, precinct-level results for national and state level elections going back to 2000. It's a great project, and when finished the dataset will be very useful for journalists, academics, campaigns, and armchair political scientists. \n",
    "\n",
    "The quality of the data OpenElections obtains varies greatly by state, and even within a state it can be an adventure - sometimes there's a nice spreadsheet in one county, but in some extreme cases volunteers have to go to County Clerk's offices and take photographs of election results and convert it by hand. \n",
    "\n",
    "Wisconsin is on the easier end - The Wisconsin Elections Commission and its predecessor the Government Accountability Board have been good about [providing statewide election results](http://elections.wi.gov/elections-voting/results) within a few weeks of an election, and in machine-readable formats, usually Excel. They're not consistent about the formatting of those Excel files but it's at least not too bad to reason about on a year-by-year basis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Wards are the atomic base unit for most elections and all voters in a ward get the same ballot. (Well, mostly. See footnote at the bottom) Wards often have different polling places per ward, but in some cases multiple wards will vote at the same polling location. The districts built from the wards are not in a strict hierarchy: a State Assembly district made up of 50 wards might well be split by a Congressional district, with 25 wards in one district and 25 in another Congressional District. Wards are always contained in one County and in one municipality. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because wards are built from whole Census blocks, demographic information is available for each ward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wards may get bigger or new wards may be created due to annexations and changes to municipal boundaries, but once created at the start of a new redistricting cycle, a ward is usually not deleted and they have stable ID numbers.  The Legislative Technology Services Bureau publishes a map and shapefiles for the wards and gives each ward an equivient of a FIPS code that can be used for a database/GIS join. The maps are published twice a year to reflect municipal boundary changes. Election results need to be paired with the current shapefile for best accuracy - using a 2016 shapefile with the 2012 election results will be off on the boundaries of muncipalities, though most wards will still look the same. (One exception: when the entire municipality is deleted, the LTSB stops including the old wards for it)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately for Wisconsin election data users, while Wisconsin votes by ward, it does not necessarily report by ward. Only cities of greater than 35,000 people are required to report each ward individually. Smaller municipalites are permitted to combine results into [\"reporting units\"](http://elections.wi.gov/sites/default/files/publication/65/ea_wards_districts_reporting_units_annexations_f_18339.pdf) of multiple wards. All wards in a reporting unit must share the same districts, and because different elections cover districts, the reporting units may vary every election, though they're typically the same. There are usually around 3600 reporting units per election, and in the 2014 fall election there were 6,634 wards in Wisconsin. \n",
    "\n",
    "The \"reporting units\" do not get any sort of geographical identifier like a FIPS code. In the reported data collected by the Elections Commission, the reporting unit is an unstructured string. However, there is a prescribed format for [how clerks should name reporting units](http://elections.wi.gov/node/1298) that in theory contains all of the information necessary to decide what wards are included in a reporting unit. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sadly, the Reporting units are created by humans, and Wisconsin has 1,927 different clerks who are potentially creating reporting unit names, few of whom think about \"how can a computer parse this\", and not all of whom follow exactly the guidnance set out by the Elections Commission. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will first cover how to normalize reporting units. Then, we'll move on to joining GeoData. To normalize, we will use a mix of code and hand-editing to create a file that users of OpenElection data can reference, and lookup which wards (and which GeoIDs) are associated with a given row of the election results data. All of the notebooks can be found in a [Github repo](https://github.com/epaulson/WI_Reporting_To_GEOID)"

    "*** One note about wards. Earlier, we said that all voters in a ward get the same ballot. This is not true in the case of school board elections. School district boundaries do not follow municipal boundaries, so some wards are split between different districts. The Elections Commission calls these 'District Combos', and the Voter Registration system records which District Combo a voter lives in and which ballot they should get. (In fact, not only do school district boundaries not follow municipal boundaries, they don't even follow parcel boundaries. There are a few condos in Madison where the School District boundary runs through the condo. In that case, for purposes of \"residency\", the district that the bedroom falls into decides which district the voter lives in.) \n",
