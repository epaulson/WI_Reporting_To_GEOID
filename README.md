A work-in-progress for converting Wiscosnin election reporting units to a something usable with a shapefile. See the Jupyter notebooks for the details:

- NormalizingReportingUnits fixes Wisconsin "Reporting Units" into something easier to process
- JoiningGeoIDs takes the normalized Reporting Units from OpenElections data and combines them with the Wisconsin Legislative Technical Services Bureau's GIS data, to make them easier to map.
- GISHacks was 10 minutes of Googling to see about showing a map inline in a Jupyter Notebook. mplleaflet is super-cool
